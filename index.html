  <h1>About Me></h1>
  <p> I am a huge science nerd and music lover. I studied neurobiology at UC Irvine but my secret love is physics. My two favorite things are reading (just about anything) and listening to music, preferably live. But my greatest joy is being a wife and mother to a beautiful little two year old. </p>

<p>I am currently a sales operations analyst at a SaaS company. I am also a certified Salesforce administrator. As our company continues to grow, the need for greater business automation and customization of Salesforce has really become apparent. I would love to become developer certified to be able to fully customize this tool for my company.</p>
